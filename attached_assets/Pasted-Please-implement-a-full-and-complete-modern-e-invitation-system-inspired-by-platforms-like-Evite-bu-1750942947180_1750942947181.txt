Please implement a full and complete modern e-invitation system inspired by platforms like Evite, but supercharged for Vibes, our next-gen party experience app.

 VibeInvite: Feature-Rich E-Invitation System
 Modern & Intuitive Invitation Dashboard

o	Track engagement with live analytics—opens, RSVPs, shares

Smart RSVP Options

•	Auto-reminders sent via push, email, or SMS, customizable by the host

 Social Sharing & Collaboration
•	Easily share invites via social platforms or generate QR codes
