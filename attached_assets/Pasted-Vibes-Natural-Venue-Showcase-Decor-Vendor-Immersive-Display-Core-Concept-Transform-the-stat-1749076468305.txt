Vibes “Natural Venue Showcase” – Decor Vendor Immersive Display

 Core Concept
Transform the static “decor vendor profile” into an immersive, real-world showcase:
 Vendors display real-life setups within actual venue halls.
 Hosts can virtually walk through the decorated venue, see details, and book instantly.
 Boosts vendor credibility and helps hosts visualize the decor in context.

 Key Features
 1. Venue Hall Digital Twins
•	Partner with popular event venues to digitally scan the venue space (via 360° cameras, LiDAR, or photogrammetry).
•	Create 3D digital twins of the halls.
•	Vendors book time slots to physically decorate these halls and have them scanned.

 2. Natural Decor Showcase Days
•	Organize “Showcase Days” where vendors set up real decor themes (boho, luxury, minimalist, floral, etc.) inside the venue.
•	Use professional photos/videos to capture the entire vibe.
•	Vendors can rotate themes (spring, summer, festival, wedding) seasonally.

 3. Interactive 360° Virtual Tours
•	In-app, hosts can explore these interactive 360° tours—like Google Street View but for parties!
•	Tap/click on decor elements for details:
o	Florals: price per table
o	Archways: vendor name, color variations
o	Lighting: customizable options
•	Info overlays explain materials, sustainability, and rental/purchase costs.

 4. Short Video Clips & Live Walkthroughs
•	Vendors can record a 2-minute pitch video explaining their design choices and vibe.
•	Option for live virtual walkthroughs—hosts book time slots to talk to vendors while they “walk” them through the setup in real time.

 5. Instant Booking & Customization

o	Save favorites (“I love this arch!”).
o	Add to a “Decor Wishlist” in the planning dashboard.
o	Instantly book the full decor package or specific items (like centerpieces only).
