Here’s a full, innovative concept for this Live Song Suggestion & Voting feature, tailored for Vibes to supercharge your party experience and make guests part of the musical journey. It combines guest engagement, real-time collaboration, and seamless DJ integration:

🎵 Vibely Live Song Suggestion & DJ Integration

 Core Idea
Partygoers can suggest songs they want to hear during the party—not just beforehand. Guests add tracks to a shared live playlist, vote on favorites, and the DJ can see and spin the top picks, ensuring the music evolves with the crowd’s energy.

 How It Works
1️ ive Party Mode
•	Host activates “Live Song Suggestions” from the “My Event” dashboard.
•	Guests automatically get a “Suggest a Song” button on their Vibes party screen.

2️ Guest Song Suggestion Panel
•	Guests can:
o	Search from Spotify, Apple Music, or upload a YouTube link.
o	Add a short note: “This will hype everyone!”
o	Limit 3–5 active suggestions per guest to keep things curated.

3️ Song Voting & Rating
•	All suggestions appear in a live feed:
o	Song title, artist, guest’s name.
o	Vote button: ❤️ or 👍
•	Songs are ranked by votes in real time.

4️ DJ Integration Panel
•	DJs see:
o	The Top 10–20 most-voted songs in a special “Live Crowd Picks” section.
o	Live emoji reactions from guests on each song (e.g., 🔥, 🥳).
•	DJs can choose to:
o	Play the most-voted tracks.
o	Curate and blend in suggestions dynamically to keep the vibe flowing.

5️ Seamless Sync with DJ Tools
•	If DJ uses a digital controller or software (like Serato, Rekordbox, Virtual DJ):
o	Vibely can export the top songs list (API or CSV) for the DJ to import as a crate.
•	Or, Vibely can display a floating overlay on the DJ’s screen (if using a laptop), so they can watch the live leaderboard without leaving their deck.

 Key Features & Safeguards
•	Spam Control:
o	Hosts can approve/deny suggestions or set a song cooldown timer (e.g., can’t suggest same song twice in 30 minutes).

•	Privacy Settings:
o	Hosts can let anyone contribute or only invited guests.
