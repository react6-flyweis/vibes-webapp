Next-Gen Features to Make Vibely Irresistible

 1. AI-Powered Theme Generator

o	Menu ideas
o	Music playlist
o	Decor suggestions with links to buy
•	Why it's enticing: Planning becomes inspirational, not just logistical.

 2. Guest DNA/Vibe Matchmaking
•	How it works: With opt-in questions or social logins, guests are “vibe-matched” to others they might click with.
•	Use cases: networking parties, weddings, singles events, or friend-of-friend mixers.
•	Bonus: Creates seating suggestions or icebreaker teams automatically.

 3. Augmented Reality (AR) Decor Preview
•	How it works: Use your phone’s camera to visualize decorations or furniture setup in your real space before you rent or buy.
