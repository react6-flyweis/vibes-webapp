Vibely Marketing Ad Component (Written Concept)
The Vibely Marketing Ad Component is a dedicated promotional feature that allows businesses and vendors to advertise their products or services directly to Vibely users. This component is built into the platform under a clearly labeled section—“Promote Your Business”—and is designed to be simple, engaging, and effective for local and event-related advertisers.

Purpose
To enable businesses (e.g., liquor stores, DJs, caterers, decor companies) to submit, showcase, and promote their offerings to event hosts and guests using Vibely, thus creating a new monetization stream for the platform while adding value to users.
